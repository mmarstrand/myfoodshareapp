# FoodShare

This app was developed in 4 weeks and is my final project at neue fische - a 12-weeks fulltime & intensive web development bootcamp.

## About this app

FoodShare is a foodsharing app with a marketplace to find or share food item: Don't waste it, share it. In the app, users can fill in a description and upload a photo of food items that they would like to give away and publish it on the marketplace. On the marketplace, hungry users can search for food items, reserve items and display the reserved items in their basket.

## How to start it

- Check package.json for dependencies
- Install npm packages: run **npm init** and **npm install**
- To start the localhost and the server at the same time run **npm start**
- This app also works with a styleguide through docz. To get started you need to run:
  **npm run docz:dev**
